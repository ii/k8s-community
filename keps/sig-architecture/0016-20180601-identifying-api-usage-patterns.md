## Summary

The cultural concepts of mihi and whakapapa are the foundation of this KEP.
The application of these concepts within our community ecosystem
deserves a shout out to the Māori of Aoteroa, Land of the Long White Cloud.

New Zealand hasn’t been populated for very long compared to the rest of the world.
The first people (Māori) arrived on waka (canoes) around the 15th century.
For Maori people today, the name of the specific waka that their ancestors arrived on,
combined with their own genealogical journey defines who they are
(in a very meaningful specific way). When mihi (formal introductions) are made,
they include their own parental lineage back to the name of the waka their ancestors arrived in.
The knowledge and communication of this history often leads to newly introduced people
becoming cognitive of familial historic connections between them.
This concrete and relational definition of identity is called their whakapapa.

Te Reo/Māori: He mea nui ki a tātau ō tātau whakapapa (HP 1991:1).
English: Our genealogies are important to us.

_**Who are you?**_ _**Why are you here?**_

Let’s enable any application, using our official Kubernetes libraries, to include the answer to these questions for each interaction with the APIServer.

The aggregated clusterwide correlation of identity and user journey with each API request/response would provide the raw metadata necessary explore the unseen, yet interwoven patterns of real-world user journeys within the Kubernetes community.

## Motivation

We need an _**atlas of the invisible and undefined tribal patterns**_ within the ecosystem of our community.

This map would help _**chart our course of development, testing, and conformance**_ based on actual Kubernetes usage patterns.

### Goals

* Enable communication of _'Who are you?'_ and _'Why are you here?'_
  - for any application using kubernetes API
  - via the _official protocols and libraries_

* Simple aggregation of this metadata
  - cluster wide
  - community wide

#### APISnoop Goals

* Easily usable/curated community wide aggregation point

* A curated dataset for public analysis

* A community set of insights using the public datasets
  * Endpoint mappings to projects / source code / functions that use them
    * Including e2e tests / steps within tests
    * Historical endpoint/function usage patterns over time
  * Common Patterns of real world use across API endpoints
    * How does the community use/do X?
  * Machine Learning
    * What are the unseen yet common patterns?
    * What projects are using similar techniques?

### Non-Goals

* Create a Rube Goldberg machine of complexity just to enable community insight
* Any of the APISnoop Goals
  * Not part of this KEP, but they are the underlying motivations and the main end-benefits to the community

## Proposal

To aggregate identity and purpose _*at the time of API interactions*_, we need:

1. _*The who and why*_ : Define ‘identity’ and ‘purpose’
2. _*App introspection*_ : generated at time of interaction:
3. _*For all apps and the cluster itself*_ : allowing 'global' src, function, and API call mapping

### API interaction Identity (Who are you?)

Current API interaction client-‘identity’ is static and usually set in client-go
via user-agent to something like:

```
e2e.test/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
kube-apiserver/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
kube-controller-manager/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
kubectl/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
kubelet/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
kube-scheduler/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/b143093
```

Ideally our base ‘identity’ should tie an application back to particular src commit,
though some programs (like kernel info via uname) also show compile time info
like timestamp or build user/machine:

```
$ uname -a
Darwin ii.local 10.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.3.0: Fri Oct 26 1:21:00 NZT 1985; root:xnu-1504.3.12~1/RELEASE_I386 i386
```

Possibly something like:

```
kubelet/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) k8s.io/kubelet b143093 built by test-infra@buildbot-10 02/03/85 23:44
```

### API interaction Purpose (Why are you here?)
We must define a simple to implement, but contextually significant, answer to the question:
*Why are you here?*
Its difficult to glean the purpose of an application interaction by external inspection without making room for this question.

At the moment of making the API call, the application has access its own
stack and history of source code location/lines and functions
that brought it to make a request of an external API.
Disabled by default, it could be enabled by setting a variable such as `KUBE_CLIENT_SUBMIT_PURPOSE`.

Allowing the application to supply this _‘mental snapshot of purpose’_ could be as simple
as providing space in our protocol for including source and method callstacks.

### Self Identification and Purpose (What does introspection tell you?)

Introspection is available in many of the languages that have
official Kubernetes client libraries.
Go, Python, and Java all provide the ability to inspect the 
runtime and stack programmatically, and include source paths and line numbers.

It may help to provide an example introspection:

```json
"introspection": {
  "self-identity": "kube-apiserver/v1.12.0 (linux/amd64) b143093 compiled by CNCF Fri Feb 26 11:58:09 PST 2010",
  "current-purpose": [
    "k8s.io/client-go/rest.(*Request).Do()",
    "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/typed/admissionregistration/v1alpha1.(*initializerConfigurations).List()",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration.NewInitializerConfigurationManager.func1()",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration.(*poller).sync()",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration.sync)-fm()",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait.JitterUntil.func1()",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait.JitterUntil()",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait.Until()",
    "runtime.goexit()"
  ],
  "current-reasoning": [
    "k8s.io/client-go/rest/request.go:807",
    "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/typed/admissionregistration/v1alpha1/initializerconfiguration.go:79",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration/initializer_manager.go:42",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration/configuration_manager.go:155",
    "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/configuration/configuration_manager.go:151",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait/wait.go:133",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait/wait.go:134",
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait/wait.go:88",
    "runtime/asm_amd64.s:2361"
  ],
}

```

### How do we communicate these larger concepts of identity and purpose?

Currently the freeform concept of identity is limited what can fit within the user-agent field. 
Support for recording the [user-agent field in our audit-events](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64812) was recently added, but our initial explorations depend on that field allowing up to ?k.

We need to explore alternatives for conveying identity and purpose.
  * use different channels
  * compress the information to fit in 1k
  * raise the user-agent size limit to ?k to include this approach.

### Tying it all together: (How do I turn this on?)

If all applications are compiled against a client-go (or other supported library)
and support the env var `KUBE_CLIENT_SUBMIT_PURPOSE`,
then deploying kubernetes itself with it set should
enable all kubernetes components to begin transmitting identity and purpose.

Setting this variable on all pods could be accomplished with
an admission or initialization controller allowing every binary
run on and within the cluster to do the same.

Currently this data is transmitted via user-agent,
so configuring an audit-logging webhook,
dynamic or otherwise, would allow centralized aggregation.

### User Stories

#### SIG Component 'end-user' identification and usage patterns

As a SIG member, who uses the components we curate and what are they doing with them?

#### SIG informed test writing / conformance patterns

As a SIG member choosing test to write/upgrade to conformance tests,
what patterns and endpoints occur within our community vs what we currently test for.

#### Developer with a relational / community view

As a developer, I'd like to know the existing tests and applications
that have similar patterns or hit the endpoints I'm interested in.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints


Audit-logging is not yet dynamically configurable,
but is being discussed in the Dynamic Audit Configuration KEP.

User-Agent is may not the field to use,
considering the current expectation of what it might contain,
both size and content wise.

The data is interesting,
because you get to see the callstacks for all the components in kubernetes,
identifying the functions and line numbers making the calls.

### Risks and Mitigations

Leaking callstacks from applications that don’t want to have the ability to be enabled.
The default would need to be off, only when configured to do so via a KUBE_CALLSTACK_HASH style env var.

To limit exposing local path names and source,
client-go could instead generate a hash of the data
(generalized, so its just the paths+linums under $GOPATH),
however this would either reduce the data to,
"I'm here for the same reason as last time, can't tell you what it is."
While useful, it definitely reduces our insight,
or adds some complexity if we need to map the hashes back to their full context.

## Graduation Criteria

- [ ] TBD

## Implementation History

- 06/27/2018: initial design via google doc
- 07/11/2018: submission of KEP
- 07/??/2018: sponsorship by sig-????

## Drawbacks [optional]

Some feel this level of client ‘debugging’ doesn't belong in server-side logs. 

## Alternatives [optional]

Log sufficient information in the client-side logs to correlate the request with the audit logs.
The two sets of logs could then be combined programmatically as needed.

The best way to do this would be to log the audit-id header that is returned on the api response, and can be used to uniquely identify the corresponding audit logs.
